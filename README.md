Codes and dataset information supporting our paper "Fifty-year changes of the world ocean's surface layer in response to climate change"

1) All information about databases that entered the calculation are provided in the directory Database
2) Codes to compute mixed-layer properties and strafication are in the directory: Computing MLD and Stratification from Individual Profiles
3) Codes to compute local generalised mixed linear regression are in the directory: LocalRegression

Main figures are ploted using the code: MLDtrend_revision_v4.m
The computed mean and trends of mixed-layer properties and trends can be found here (with DOI): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4073174
