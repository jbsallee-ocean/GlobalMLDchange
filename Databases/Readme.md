#### In this Directory, all informations on Original datasets can be found. 
#### We gathered observations from four main sources :

1) We used the [**MEOP-CTD database**](http://www.meop.net/database/meop-databases/density-of-data.html), and in particular the 2018-04 release of the dataset (with DOI) https://doi.org/10.17882/45461

2) We used all profile observations from the [**International Argo program**](http://www.argodatamgt.org/), downloaded from the Global data center hosted by IFREMER that can be accessed here: ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo. The download was performed in June 2019. The list of WMO number of each plateform downloaded can be found in the current directory in the file called: "WMOlist_ARGO.mat"

3) We used all the ship-based profile observations containing both temperature, salinity, and pressure information, downloaded from the [**NOAA World Ocean Database**](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/dbsearch/dbsearch.html). The download was performed in June 2019. The list of World Ocean Database Unique Cast id that was downloaded can be found in the current directory, in the five files:  "listeWOD_201812_1.txt", "listeWOD_201812_2.txt", "listeWOD_201812_3.txt", "listeWOD_201812_4.txt", "listeWOD_201812_5.txt". 

4) We used all the ship-based profile observations containing both temperature, salinity, and pressure information, that was originally gathered as part of the [**Southern Ocean Data Base**](http://woceatlas.tamu.edu/), that is stored online and can be freely downloaded (with DOI): https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4071923
