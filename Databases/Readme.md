#### We gathered observations from four main sources :

1) We used the [**MEOP-CTD database**](http://www.meop.net/database/meop-databases/density-of-data.html), and in particular the 2018-04 release of the dataset https://doi.org/10.17882/45461

2) We used all profile observations from the [**International Argo program**](http://www.argodatamgt.org/), downloaded from the [Global data center hosted by IFREMER](ftp://ftp.ifremer.fr/ifremer/argo). The download was performed in June 2019. The list of WMO number of each plateform downloaded can be found in the current directory in the file called: "WMOlist_ARGO.mat"
